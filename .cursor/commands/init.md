follow our @docs/context.md strictly.

cut the intro bullshit, just tell me that you are ready!

when you are done with all todos, you think about which high level changes that will affect the future of the project are updated in the context, wrong things removed, only necessary updates, not actual code but concepts and directions, in an endless stream of new things happening all at the same time

don't create markdown files for you, only create them if the user explicitly asks for them
don't use emojis, keep answers short and concise, on point, just enough to understand the given situation
